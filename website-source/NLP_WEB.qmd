## Introduction

This study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to investigate discussions related to Technology, Science, and Artificial Intelligence on Reddit. We analyze community discourse across multiple subreddits to identify dominant topics, track sentiment trends over time, and explore thematic differences in ethical, technical, and societal discussions. Methods include Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, VADER for sentiment analysis, and rule-based text classification to generate word clouds, providing both quantitative and visual insights into the semantic structure and community focus within AI- and technology-related discussions.

## Business Question 5: What are the dominant topics and trends within fast-growing technology-related subreddits?

As shown in the figure, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model identifies ten distinct topics from the corpus, each represented by its most influential keywords. These keywords provide an interpretable summary of the semantic focus of each discovered topic.

**Topic 0** is characterized by keywords such as *data*, *apple*, *ai*, *science*, *user*, and *marketing*, suggesting that this topic centers on discussions related to data science, artificial intelligence, and technology-driven business practices.

**Topic 1** includes terms such as *karma*, *comment*, *subreddit*, *message*, and *questions*, indicating that it reflects conversations about community interactions, platform moderation, and posting behaviors within online forums such as Reddit.

**Topic 2** is defined by words like *human*, *ai*, *power*, *energy*, *car*, and *years*, representing discourse around human–AI relations, emerging technologies, and long-term trends in energy and transportation.

**Topic 3** contains keywords including *word*, *images*, *water*, *read*, and *data*, pointing to content associated with information extraction, text and image processing, and data-driven analysis.

**Topic 4** focuses on terms such as *code*, *python*, *data*, *using*, *language*, and *windows*, clearly corresponding to programming-related discussions involving software tools, coding practices, and computational workflows.

**Topic 5** includes *reddit*, *app*, *api*, *change*, *party*, *commercial*, and *pricing*, which collectively suggest themes related to application development, API usage, and commercial product or platform changes.

**Topic 6** is composed of more conversational keywords such as *something*, *never*, *someone*, *bad*, *lol*, and *yeah*, indicating informal, colloquial exchanges or personal expressions within the corpus.

**Topic 7** features terms like *learn*, *help*, *project*, *learning*, *software*, and *job*, pointing to discussions focused on learning resources, technical support, project development, and career-oriented themes.

**Topic 8** is defined by *job*, *jobs*, *entrepreneur*, *pay*, *business*, and *company*, representing topics related to employment, entrepreneurship, compensation, and broader business activities.

**Topic 9** includes keywords such as *chatgpt*, *bot*, *prompt*, *conversation*, *post*, and *reply*, indicating discourse involving conversational agents, prompt design, and user–system interactions.

Overall, these topics illustrate the LDA model’s ability to uncover coherent thematic structures within the dataset and to organize large volumes of text into interpretable clusters.

## Business Question 6: What are the baseline emotional patterns of discussions about AI and emerging technologies?

**Method:** We applied the VADER sentiment analysis tool to each comment and submission to calculate a `compound` score, which ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive). Scores are then categorized as positive (>=0.05), neutral, or negative (<=-0.05).

**Analysis of Sentiment Distribution:**
The stacked bar chart below shows the *proportion* of comments falling into each sentiment category for the most active subreddits.

![Sentiment distribution](../data/plots/NLP_Q2_sentiment_distribution_stacked.png)

- **Finding 1: Neutrality is Dominant.** Across almost all communities, the vast majority of comments are classified as neutral. This indicates that discussions on technical and scientific topics are often objective, informative, and factual rather than emotionally charged.
- **Finding 2: Positive Skew.** In most subreddits, the proportion of positive comments is noticeably higher than negative ones. This suggests a generally constructive or optimistic underlying tone, even within objective discussions.

**Analysis of Average Compound Score:**
The bar chart below visualizes the average `compound` sentiment score for each subreddit.

![compound](../data/plots/NLP_Q2_sentiment_by_subreddit_bar.png)

- **Finding 3: Mildly Positive Atmosphere.** Consistent with the distribution analysis, the average sentiment score for most subreddits is slightly above zero, confirming a modest but persistent positive inclination. For example, communities like `AIforGood` and `OpenAI` show a stronger positive leaning.
- **Finding 4: Lack of Strong Negativity.** Very few communities exhibit a negative average sentiment, and even those that do are only slightly negative. This reinforces the conclusion that the overall discussion atmosphere is not contentious but rather balanced and leaning towards positive.


## Business Question 7: How do external technological or policy events disrupt or reshape existing discussion patterns in online technology-related communities?

We selected a set of representative subreddits and categorized them into four major groups:

AI/ML: This category includes ChatGPT, OpenAI, ArtificialIntelligence, MachineLearning, GenerativeAI, and AIethics. It focuses on discussions related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, generative AI, and associated ethical considerations.

Programming/Data: This group comprises datascience, bigdata, programming, Python, learnprogramming, and CloudComputing, highlighting topics in programming, data science, and technical learning.

**Analysis of Sentiment Trend:**
The chart below plots the average monthly sentiment for four distinct categories of subreddits. Key industry and policy events are marked with vertical lines to contextualize the trends.

![Sentiment trend](../data/plots/NLP_Q3_sentiment_trend_all_categories_VADER.png)

- **Overall Stability:** The primary finding is that sentiment across all four categories remains remarkably stable over the year, with average scores consistently hovering in the neutral-to-mildly-positive range (0.05 to 0.15). This suggests a mature and steady discussion environment that is not prone to dramatic, long-term shifts in mood.

- **Event-Driven Fluctuations in AI/ML:** The **AI/ML** category (blue line) displays the most sensitivity to external events.
    - Following the **Gemini launch (Feb 2024)** and the **EU AI Act (Apr 2024)**, this category shows a distinct upward trend, indicating a period of increased optimism and positive discussion.
    - This suggests that major product releases and significant regulatory milestones can temporarily boost positive sentiment within core AI communities.

- **Consistency in Other Categories:** The `Programming/Data`, `Science/STEM`, and `Tech/Future Trends` categories show even less volatility, reinforcing the idea that their discussion tones are less influenced by specific AI-related news cycles.

### Topic Trend
We also analyzed the distribution of the ten topics (discovered in RQ5) over time.

![Topic Trend](../data/plots/NLP_Q1_topic_trends_over_time.png)

- **Conclusion:** As shown in the stacked area chart, the relative prevalence of each topic remains highly consistent throughout the year. There are no major shifts, indicating that the fundamental areas of discussion within these communities are stable and not subject to seasonal or event-driven changes. For example, "informal conversation" (Topic 6) and "human-AI relations" (Topic 2) consistently remain the most dominant topics.

## Business Question 8: How do users shape topic emphasis and sentiment dynamics across science, technology, and AI subreddits?

To explore the semantic characteristics of discussions related to Technology, Science, and AI, word clouds were created to visualize the most frequent and prominent terms within each topic group.

Discussion content was classified into four categories using a rule-based approach:

- Technical: Text containing keywords related to model architectures, neural networks, training, or optimization.

- Ethical: Text containing keywords related to ethics, bias, regulations, or fairness.

- Societal: Text containing keywords related to societal impact, education, policy, or employment.

- Other: Text not matching any of the above patterns.

This approach allows the word clouds to intuitively highlight the main topics and language features within each category, providing a visual understanding of community focus.

![WordCloud](data/plots/NLP_Q4_wordclouds_by_topic_clean.png)

**Analysis:**
The word clouds reveal clear thematic distinctions between the different categories of discussion:

- **Ethical Discussion:** Prominent keywords include **regulation**, **responsibility**, **human**, **bias**, **fairness**, and **moral**. This indicates that discourse in this category centers on the governance, accountability, and human-centric implications of AI and technology.

- **Societal Discussion:** Dominant words include **job**, **work**, **company**, **society**, **future**, and **impact**. This highlights a focus on the real-world consequences of technology, particularly concerning employment, corporate influence, and long-term social structures.

- **Technical Discussion:** Key terms are **model**, **data**, **training**, **LLM**, **neural**, and **architecture**. This demonstrates a clear focus on the mechanics of AI development, including model design, data handling, and the specifics of training large language models.

- **Other Discussion:** This category is characterized by general or meta-discussion words like **removed**, **know**, **need**, **work**, and **time**. It likely captures content related to moderation, general inquiries, or conversations that do not fit neatly into the other three themes.
