This study examines activity dynamics, user engagement, attention concentration, and cross-community interactions across major AI and technology subreddits from June 2023 to July 2024. Through large-scale data processing with Spark and Python, we explore how community participation evolves over time, which subreddits retain returning users most effectively, how discussion attention is distributed across posts, and whether AI/tech communities share overlapping user bases. These analyses provide a foundational understanding of behavioral patterns within the broader Reddit AI ecosystem.


## Data Overview

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Dataset Summary Table"
import pandas as pd
df_sum = pd.read_csv("../data/csv/dataset_summary_final.csv")
df_sum
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-subcap: "This table shows subreddit statistics sorted in descending order."
df_stat = pd.read_csv("../data/csv/subreddit_statistics_final.csv")
df_stat.sort_values(by="total_rows", ascending=False)
```

## RQ1: How has community activity evolved across AI and technology subreddits over time?

**Business Question:**  
How have monthly post and comment volumes changed across major AI and technology subreddits? Do any noticeable surges correspond to major AI or technology events?

**Analysis Approach:**  
- Use Spark to aggregate posts and comments by subreddit and month  
- Visualize monthly activity trends to compare engagement patterns and identify periods of rapid growth or decline  

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv("../data/csv/rq1_activity.csv")
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
for sub in df['subreddit'].unique():
    subdf = df[df['subreddit']==sub]
    plt.plot(subdf['month'], subdf['total_activity'], marker='o', label=sub)
plt.title("Monthly Activity - AI/Tech Subreddits")
plt.xlabel("Month"), plt.ylabel("Posts + Comments"), plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.tight_layout()
```

**Findings:**  
- **technology** consistently dominates overall activity, peaking above 300,000 monthly interactions in mid-2023 and again in mid-2024, reflecting its broad and sustained user interest.  
- **ChatGPT** shows several pronounced surges—particularly around late 2023 and early 2024—likely corresponding to major AI announcements and product updates.  
- **Futurology** exhibits a steady upward trend throughout the year, suggesting growing interest in future-oriented and AI-related discussions.  
- **OpenAI** experiences sharp but short-lived spikes (e.g., late 2023 and mid-2024), consistent with event-driven engagement tied to major releases or public statements.  
- Smaller communities such as **MachineLearning**, **technews**, and **ArtificialInteligence** remain relatively stable, showing modest fluctuations but no large-scale surges.  

Overall, activity patterns indicate that major AI/tech events tend to drive short-term spikes in engagement, while broader technology interest maintains high baseline levels throughout the entire period.



## RQ2: Which AI-related subreddits demonstrate the strongest user engagement and retention over time?

**Business Question:**  
Which AI communities successfully retain users across months—indicating sustained engagement—rather than attracting only short-term or event-driven traffic?

**Analysis Approach:**  
- Use Spark to compute the monthly *returning-to-active user ratio* for each subreddit as a proxy for retention.  
- Visualize retention trends with a heatmap to highlight which communities maintain consistent returning user activity over time.  

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv("../data/csv/rq2_engagement.csv")
pivot = df.pivot(index="month", columns="subreddit", values="engagement_ratio")
plt.figure(figsize=(11,6))
sns.heatmap(pivot, cmap="YlGnBu", linewidths=0.3)
plt.title("User Retention: Returning/Active Ratio")
plt.tight_layout()
```



**Findings:**  

- **Niche AI communities exhibit sharp fluctuations in retention.**  
  Subreddits with smaller and more specialized audiences—such as *Alethics*—show periods of extremely high retention, with ratios reaching up to ~1.0 in certain months. This indicates that when these communities experience relevant discussions or bursts of interest, the majority of users who are active in those months tend to return. However, these peaks are intermittent, suggesting that engagement in niche communities is event-driven and highly sensitive to topical relevance rather than sustained momentum.

- **Mainstream AI subreddits maintain moderate but stable retention levels.**  
  Larger communities like *ChatGPT*, *MachineLearning*, and *OpenAI* display retention ratios that consistently fall within the 0.2–0.4 range. Although these values are lower than those of niche subreddits during their peak months, their stability reflects a healthier and more durable engagement structure: a substantial portion of users continue returning month over month, supported by continual content flow, broader topic coverage, and steady user inflow.

- **Temporal patterns reveal community-specific engagement cycles.**  
  Retention for niche subreddits tends to be more volatile, with visible month-to-month jumps. This volatility suggests communities formed around narrow or emerging topics experience engagement surges only when new developments occur. In contrast, mainstream subreddits exhibit smoother seasonal variations that correspond more closely to long-term trends in AI and technology discourse.

- **General AI forums demonstrate stronger baseline cohesion.**  
  Communities like *MachineLearning* and *OpenAI* do not show extreme highs or lows but instead maintain a persistent core of recurring users. This indicates well-established community identity and ongoing discussions that encourage users to return even outside of major events.

- **Overall interpretation:**  
  The heatmap highlights a clear divide between niche and broad AI communities. Niche subreddits achieve high short-term engagement but lack consistency, while mainstream subreddits sustain steady returning-user activity, suggesting stronger community cohesion and long-term user retention. These patterns underline how topic breadth, community size, and event-driven interest all influence user retention dynamics across Reddit's AI ecosystem.



## RQ3: How concentrated is attention within AI and tech discussions?

**Business Question:**  
To what extent are conversations driven by a small number of highly viral posts, versus being distributed more evenly across many posts? In other words, do certain subreddits exhibit stronger attention inequality than others?

**Analysis Approach:**  
- Use Spark to compute the Gini coefficient of comments per post for each subreddit, where higher Gini values indicate more concentrated attention.  
- Visualize distribution patterns using violin plots to show variability across months and bar charts to compare average attention concentration between subreddits.

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("../data/csv/rq3_gini.csv")

sns.violinplot(
data=df,
x="subreddit",
y="gini_comments",
palette="coolwarm",
inner="box",
hue="subreddit",  
legend=False     
)

plt.title("Discussion Gini Index by Subreddit")
plt.xlabel("Subreddit")
plt.ylabel("Gini (Comments/Post)")
plt.xticks(rotation=30, ha="right")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

```{python}
#| echo: false
avg_gini = df.groupby("subreddit")[["gini_comments", "gini_scores"]].mean().reset_index()
sns.barplot(data=avg_gini, x="gini_comments", y="subreddit", palette="viridis",hue="subreddit")
plt.title("Average Gini Index - Attention Concentration")
plt.xlabel("Average Gini (Comments/Post)")
plt.tight_layout()
```


**Findings:**  

- **Technology and ChatGPT exhibit the strongest concentration of attention, with average Gini values approaching 0.88–0.90.**  
  This indicates that engagement in these subreddits is dominated by a handful of highly viral posts. When major announcements, controversies, or breakthrough AI tools emerge, these communities often experience rapid surges in attention focused on a small number of trending threads. As a result, the distribution of comments becomes heavily skewed: most posts receive modest engagement while a small set of “blockbuster” discussions absorb the majority of user activity. Such dynamics are typical of large, heterogeneous audiences that respond quickly to broad-interest or news-driven content.

- **Professional and technical communities—including MachineLearning and datascience—show significantly lower attention inequality (Gini ≈ 0.70–0.78).**  
  These subreddits display a more evenly distributed engagement pattern, where comments accumulate across a wider range of posts rather than concentrating around a few viral threads. This suggests that discussions are more specialized, sustained, and topic-focused, attracting recurring contributions from users who are participating for informational or expert-driven purposes rather than reacting to viral events. The lower Gini values imply that these communities support richer, multi-thread parallel discussions typical of technical forums.

- **OpenAI occupies a middle ground, with moderate concentration levels (~0.75–0.80) but higher variability across months.**  
  This pattern reflects the community’s sensitivity to event-driven cycles: during major OpenAI releases or controversies, a few posts dominate the discourse, while in quieter periods, engagement becomes more evenly distributed.

- **Overall, the Gini-based comparisons highlight a structural divide between general-interest and expert-focused AI communities.**  
  Large, news-oriented subreddits tend to exhibit “winner-take-most” behavior, where viral content disproportionately shapes the conversation. In contrast, subreddits centered on technical learning, research, or professional practice support more equitable attention patterns, indicating a healthier distribution of dialogue across diverse posts. These findings reveal how audience composition, content type, and topic breadth jointly influence the way discussions unfold within online AI and technology communities.


## RQ4: Do AI and technology subreddits share overlapping user communities?

**Business Question:**  
To what extent do users participate across multiple AI and technology subreddits?
Are some communities closely interconnected through shared user bases, while others attract distinct, non-overlapping audiences?

**Analysis Approach:**  

- Extract unique users from each subreddit using Spark.
- Compute pairwise Jaccard similarity to quantify user overlap.
- Visualize the subreddit-to-subreddit similarity matrix using a heatmap to highlight shared and distinct audience patterns.

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Jaccard similarity matrix
df = pd.read_csv("../data/csv/rq4_user_overlap_matrix.csv", index_col=0)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(
    df.astype(float),
    cmap="Blues",
    linewidths=0.5,
    square=True,
    cbar_kws={"label": "Jaccard Similarity"}
)

plt.title("Cross-Subreddit User Overlap (Jaccard Similarity)", fontsize=14, weight="bold")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.yticks(rotation=0)
plt.tight_layout()
```

**Findings:**  

- Overall user overlap across the selected AI and technology subreddits is low, with most Jaccard similarity values close to zero. This indicates that these communities attract largely distinct audiences rather than sharing a common user base.

- General-interest subreddits such as technology and technews show only weak connections to more specialized communities (e.g., MachineLearning, robotics, OpenAI), suggesting that mainstream tech discussions do not substantially overlap with expert-driven or AI-focused forums.

- Similarly, AI-related subreddits such as ChatGPT, OpenAI, and ArtificialInteligence do not exhibit strong user overlap with one another, implying that users tend to engage in platform- or topic-specific communities rather than participating broadly across the AI ecosystem.

- The near-diagonal heatmap pattern reinforces the idea that each subreddit represents a relatively independent audience segment, with minimal cross-community engagement or user migration during the study period.


## Key Takeaways

- Community activity is highly event-driven, with major AI/tech announcements producing clear surges in monthly posts and comments. Among all communities, the technology subreddit consistently maintains the highest baseline activity, highlighting its broad relevance and responsiveness to industry-wide events.
- User retention patterns differ sharply across subreddit types. Specialized communities (e.g., science, robotics) show intermittent but intense periods of returning-user engagement, whereas larger mainstream AI communities such as ChatGPT and technology exhibit more stable, steady retention, indicating continuous community participation.
- Attention concentration varies with community purpose. General tech forums display high Gini coefficients (≈0.9), suggesting a “viral hit” structure where a few posts dominate engagement. In contrast, technical and research-focused subreddits (e.g., MachineLearning) distribute attention more evenly (Gini ≈0.7), supporting sustained, multi-threaded discussions rather than viral dynamics.
- Cross-community user overlap is minimal, showing that AI and technology subreddits maintain largely distinct audience groups. Even closely related AI subreddits share limited user participation, indicating strong topical specialization rather than fluid cross-community engagement.
