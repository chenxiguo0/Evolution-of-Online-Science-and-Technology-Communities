## Project Overview

**High-Level Problem Statement:**

How do online science and technology communities on Reddit evolve, interact, and structure their discussions around AI and emerging technologies?

### Dataset

- **Source:** Reddit Comments and Submissions
- **Time Period:** 2023-06-01 to 2024-07-31
- **Subreddits:** A curated list of science, technology, and AI-related subreddits, including `ChatGPT`, `technology`, `ArtificialInteligence`, `MachineLearning`, `Futurology`, `datascience`, `OpenAI`, and more.
- **Scale:** ~13.4 million rows (~12.6M comments, ~0.8M submissions)
- **Size:** ~13.4 GB

### Business Questions

We address 10 business questions spanning three analytical approaches:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

1.  How has community activity evolved across science, technology, and AI subreddits over time?
2.  Which technology-related subreddits demonstrate the strongest user engagement and retention over time?
3.  How concentrated is attention within technology-related discussions (comments and scores)?
4.  Do science, technology, and AI subreddits share overlapping user communities?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

5.  What are the dominant topics and trends within fast-growing technology-related subreddits?
6.  What are the baseline emotional patterns of discussions about AI and emerging technologies?
7.  How do external technological or policy events disrupt or reshape existing discussion patterns in online technology-related communities?
8.  How do users shape topic emphasis and sentiment dynamics across science, technology, and AI subreddits?

**Machine Learning (ML):**

9.  Can high-quality Reddit comments in science, technology, and AI subreddits be predicted from comment content and basic behavioral features?
10. Can distinct discussion communities be identified within technology-related subreddits based on patterns of language use?

See [BUSINESS_QUESTIONS.md](../BUSINESS_QUESTIONS.md) for detailed technical approaches.

## Methodology

### Data Processing Infrastructure

- **Platform:** Apache Spark cluster on AWS EC2
- **Processing:** Distributed computing with PySpark
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 for data lake architecture
- **Scale:** Processing over 13 million rows of text and metadata

### Analysis Pipeline

1.  **Data Acquisition & Filtering**
    - Copied and filtered a large public Reddit dataset to relevant subreddits and timeframes.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis** → [EDA Page](EDA_WEB.qmd)
    - Analyzed temporal patterns, user engagement, attention concentration, and community overlap.
3.  **Natural Language Processing** → [NLP Page](NLP_WEB.qmd)
    - Deployed topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and rule-based text classification.
4.  **Machine Learning** → [ML Page](ML_WEB.qmd)
    - Trained and evaluated classification and clustering models to predict content quality and identify user segments.
5.  **Final Analysis** → [Conclusion](conclusion.qmd)
    - Synthesized all findings into actionable insights and business recommendations.

## Key Findings Preview

### Major Insights

1.  **Community Engagement is Event-Driven but Emotionally Stable:** User activity surges in response to major AI product launches and news, but the overall emotional tone of the communities remains consistently neutral-to-positive, showing high resilience.
2.  **A Core, Interconnected AI Community Drives the Conversation:** A handful of central AI-focused subreddits (like `r/ChatGPT`, `r/OpenAI`) share a large, active user base, acting as the primary hub for discourse that spreads to the wider tech ecosystem.
3.  **Predictive Models Can Augment, Not Replace, Human Moderation:** Our machine learning model can successfully identify the majority of high-quality comments (high recall), but its lower precision makes it best suited as a tool to assist human moderators, not fully automate their work.

### Business Impact

Our findings provide a roadmap for understanding and engaging with online technology communities. By identifying key hubs of conversation, understanding the stable emotional climate, and leveraging ML for content curation, organizations can develop more efficient and impactful communication and community management strategies.
