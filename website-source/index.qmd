## Project Overview

**High-Level Problem Statement:**

[Your overarching business problem - e.g., "How can we optimize content strategy and community management for technology-focused Reddit communities?"]

### Dataset

- **Source:** Reddit Comments and Submissions
- **Time Period:** [Your date range]
- **Subreddits:** [List your chosen subreddits]
- **Scale:** [Total rows - should be 100M+]
- **Size:** [Total GB]

### Business Questions

We address 10 business questions spanning three analytical approaches:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]
4. [Question 4]

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

5. [Question 5]
6. [Question 6]
7. [Question 7]

**Machine Learning (ML):**

8. [Question 8]
9. [Question 9]
10. [Question 10]

See [BUSINESS_QUESTIONS.md](https://github.com/your-repo/BUSINESS_QUESTIONS.md) for detailed technical approaches.

## Methodology

### Data Processing Infrastructure

- **Platform:** Apache Spark cluster on AWS EC2
