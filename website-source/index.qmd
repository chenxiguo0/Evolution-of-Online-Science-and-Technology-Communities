## Project Overview

Every day, millions of people gather on Reddit to make sense of rapid technological change. Some come to celebrate new AI breakthroughs, others to troubleshoot code, debate ethics, or simply share curiosity about the future. These conversations unfold across fragmented subreddits—each with its own tone, norms, and pace—yet they are all part of a broader ecosystem reacting in real time to the accelerating world of science and technology.

As AI tools reshape how people work, create, and communicate, online communities have become one of the most important places where public understanding takes shape. But despite the scale and influence of these spaces, we still know surprisingly little about how they evolve, what drives engagement, and how different groups organize around emerging technologies.

This leads to our core question:

**High-Level Problem:**

How do online science and technology communities on Reddit evolve, interact, and structure their discussions around AI and emerging technologies?

### Dataset

- **Source:** Reddit Comments and Submissions
- **Time Period:** 2023-06-01 to 2024-07-31
- **Subreddits:** 100 Total number of subreddits of science, technology, and AI-related subreddits, Covering AI, programming, technology, and science domains.
- **Scale:** ~13.4 million rows (~12.6M comments, ~0.8M submissions)
- **Size:** ~13.4 GB

### Business Questions

We address 10 business questions spanning three analytical approaches:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

1.  How has community activity evolved across science, technology, and AI subreddits over time?
2.  Which technology-related subreddits demonstrate the strongest user engagement and retention over time?
3.  How concentrated is attention within technology-related discussions (comments and scores)?
4.  Do science, technology, and AI subreddits share overlapping user communities?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

5.  What are the dominant topics and trends within fast-growing technology-related subreddits?
6.  What are the baseline emotional patterns of discussions about AI and emerging technologies?
7.  How do external technological or policy events disrupt or reshape existing discussion patterns in online technology-related communities?
8.  How do users shape topic emphasis and sentiment dynamics across science, technology, and AI subreddits?

**Machine Learning (ML):**

9.  Can the Quality of Reddit Comments in Science, Technology, and AI Subreddits Be Predicted from comment content and basic behavioral features?
10. Can distinct discussion communities be identified within technology-related subreddits based on patterns of language use?

See [BUSINESS_QUESTIONS.md](BUSINESS_QUESTIONS.md) for detailed technical approaches.

## Methodology

We analyzed Reddit submissions and comments from science, technology, and AI communities using a combination of EDA, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques. Data were processed with Apache Spark, aggregating posts and comments by subreddit and month to compute community activity, user retention, and attention concentration metrics. NLP features included text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF or CountVectorizer encoding, topic modeling (LDA), sentiment analysis (VADER/TextBlob), and rule-based discussion type classification. Machine learning involved Logistic Regression to predict comment quality using text and behavioral features (e.g., comment length, URL presence, posting time) and K-Means clustering (with PCA visualization) to identify distinct discussion communities.

### Data Processing Infrastructure

- **Platform:** Apache Spark cluster on AWS EC2
- **Processing:** Distributed computing with PySpark
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 for data lake architecture
- **Scale:** Processing over 13 million rows of text and metadata

### Analysis Pipeline and Navigation

1.  **Data Acquisition & Filtering**
    - Copied and filtered a large public Reddit dataset to relevant subreddits and timeframes.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis** → [EDA Page](eda.qmd)
    - Analyzed temporal patterns, user engagement, attention concentration, and community overlap.
3.  **Natural Language Processing** → [NLP Page](nlp.qmd)
    - Deployed topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and rule-based text classification.
4.  **Machine Learning** → [ML Page](ml.qmd)
    - Trained and evaluated classification and clustering models to predict content quality and identify user segments.
5.  **Final Conclusion** → [Conclusion](conclusion.qmd)
    - Synthesized all findings into actionable insights and business recommendations.
6. **Project Report** → [Report](report.qmd)
    - Summarizes the entire project pipeline, highlights key findings, and provides a cohesive narrative linking methods, results, and business relevance.

## Key Findings Preview

### Major Insights

1.  **Community Engagement is Event-Driven but Emotionally Stable:** User activity surges in response to major AI product launches and news, but the overall emotional tone of the communities remains consistently neutral-to-positive, showing high resilience.
2.  **A Core, Interconnected AI Community Drives the Conversation:** A handful of central AI-focused subreddits (like `r/ChatGPT`, `r/OpenAI`) share a large, active user base, acting as the primary hub for discourse that spreads to the wider tech ecosystem.
3.  **Most Conversations Are Casual, with a Few Tight-Knit Tech Corners:** Our research reveals that the vast majority of submissions (≈98%) cluster into everyday, natural-language discussions, while only a small portion (≈2%) forms specialized technical or programming clusters. 

### Business Impact

Our findings provide a roadmap for understanding and engaging with online technology communities. By identifying key hubs of conversation, understanding the stable emotional climate, and leveraging ML for content curation, organizations can develop more efficient and impactful communication and community management strategies.
