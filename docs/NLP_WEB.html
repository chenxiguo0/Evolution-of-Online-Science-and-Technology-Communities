<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to investigate discussions related to Technology, Science, and Artificial Intelligence on Reddit. We analyze community discourse across multiple subreddits to identify dominant topics, track sentiment trends over time, and explore thematic differences in ethical, technical, and societal discussions. Methods include Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, VADER for sentiment analysis, and rule-based text classification to generate word clouds, providing both quantitative and visual insights into the semantic structure and community focus within AI- and technology-related discussions.</p>

<p>To explore the semantic characteristics of discussions related to Technology, Science, and AI, word clouds were created to visualize the most frequent and prominent terms within each topic group.</p>
<p>Discussion content was classified into four categories using a rule-based approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical: Text containing keywords related to model architectures, neural networks, training, or optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Ethical: Text containing keywords related to ethics, bias, regulations, or fairness.</p></li>
<li><p>Societal: Text containing keywords related to societal impact, education, policy, or employment.</p></li>
<li><p>Other: Text not matching any of the above patterns.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach allows the word clouds to intuitively highlight the main topics and language features within each category, providing a visual understanding of community focus.</p>

<p><img src="data/plots/NLP_Q4_wordclouds_by_topic_clean.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>WordCloud</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In analyzing discussions related to technology, science, and artificial intelligence, the word clouds across different categories reveal distinct thematic focuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethical Discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>Prominent words include regulation, responsibility, human, know, need, and work. These terms indicate that the community’s discourse in the ethical category primarily centers on governance, accountability, and human implications of AI and technology applications. Users emphasize the formulation of rules, clarification of responsibilities, and the importance of human considerations in technological development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other Discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>Key words are removed, know, need, work, and time. This category represents more miscellaneous discussions, focusing on content management, procedural matters, or general operational issues. The emphasis is on work requirements and time management rather than technical or ethical concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Societal Discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>Dominant words include job, work, need, company, society, going, future, and human. These indicate that the discussions in this category concentrate on the societal implications of technological advancement, particularly employment, corporate operations, social structures, and future societal trends. The discourse reflects forward-looking considerations of AI and technology impacts on society.</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical Discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>Prominent words include model, human, need, data, new, time, work, training, and LLM (large language model). This demonstrates that the technical category focuses on AI model development and applications, data processing, training processes, and practical aspects of large language models, highlighting methodological and operational concerns.</p>
<p>Overall, the word clouds illustrate clear thematic distinctions: the ethical category emphasizes responsibility and governance, the societal category highlights social impact and employment, the technical category focuses on models and methods, and the other category covers miscellaneous operational issues.</p>
