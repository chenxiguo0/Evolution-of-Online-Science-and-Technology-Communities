    "text": "Research Question 9: Can we predict whether an AI-related post will become highly engaging?\nBusiness Question:\nCan we build a model to accurately predict which AI-related posts will achieve high engagement on Reddit?\nAnalysis Approach:\nThis is formulated as a binary classification task. We trained a Logistic Regression model using a rich set of features including post metadata (e.g., subreddit, submission time), and NLP-derived features (e.g., sentiment of title, dominant topic). Model performance is assessed using standard classification metrics.\nFeatures & training details: - Positive label: score &gt;= 6 (see code/ml/ml_Q1.py). - Features: TF-IDF text features (HashingTF + IDF), comment_length, has_url, hour_of_day, day_of_week. - Train/validation/test splits performed in code (approx. 80/20 overall; train/val internal split applied). - Class weighting applied to address imbalance (weightCol used in LogisticRegression). - Model saved at: code/ml/models/logistic_regression.\n\nConfusion Matrix\n\ntrue_0 → pred_0: 949,839 ; pred_1: 1,112,372\ntrue_1 → pred_0: 132,447 ; pred_1: 318,706\n\n\n\nModel performance\n\nAccuracy: 0.5047\nPrecision: 0.2227\nRecall: 0.7064\nF1-score: 0.3386\nAUC: 0.6257\n\n\nconfusion matrix: - Counts: true_0 → pred_0: 949,839 ; pred_1: 1,112,372; true_1 → pred_0: 132,447 ; pred_1: 318,706. - This indicates the model predicts many samples as positive (pred_1), producing a substantial number of false positives. The confusion matrix helps identify where the model misclassifies and guides threshold tuning or feature improvements.\n\nROC: - The ROC curve shows the model’s trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate across thresholds. The reported AUC = 0.626 (see metrics file) indicates modest discriminative ability — better than random but room for improvement. - Use this plot to compare models or to choose operating points that balance sensitivity and specificity.\n\nPrecision–Recall: - Precision = 0.223 and Recall = 0.706 (metrics file). The PR curve highlights that although recall is high (the model catches most high-engagement posts), precision is low — many predicted positives are false. - For deployment, consider threshold tuning on the PR curve to meet business needs (e.g., higher precision for automated actions, or higher recall for candidate selection).\nInterpretation & implications: - The model shows high recall but low precision: it successfully identifies most high-engagement posts but produces many false positives. This means the model is useful for candidate selection (e.g., flagging posts for manual review) but not ideal for automated posting strategies without threshold tuning. - AUC ≈ 0.626 indicates modest discriminative power; further work needed to improve robustness.\nFuture improvements: - Use embeddings (BERT / Sentence-BERT) to capture semantic meaning rather than HashingTF alone. - Incorporate richer author and subreddit metadata (author history, subreddit-specific features, prior post performance). - Try stronger classifiers (Gradient Boosting / XGBoost / LightGBM) and tune thresholds by business objective (precision vs recall tradeoffs)."

    "text": "Research Question 10: Can we forecast the next month’s public sentiment toward AI?\nBusiness Question:\nIs it possible to predict future sentiment trends regarding AI in Reddit communities, thereby enabling proactive understanding of public mood?\nAnalysis Approach:\nWe explored clustering of subreddit submissions (K-Means) to identify groups with similar sentiment/text signatures as a first step; a supervised regression pipeline for forecasting monthly sentiment remains to be implemented.\n\nCluster analysis & visualization\n\nCluster artifacts and model saved in code/ml/models/kmeans_k13.\nCluster analysis summary: data/csv/ML2_cluster_analysis.csv.\nElbow chart for K selection: data/plots/ML2_elbow_method.png.\n\n\nclustering: - The clustering plot groups subreddits by similar text/sentiment patterns. Key clusters include cluster 10 (largest, many tokens like ‘removed’, ‘ai’, ‘chatgpt’) and cluster 8 (conversational language). - These clusters can be used to build cluster-specific forecasting models or to include cluster id as a feature in regression/classification tasks.\nSelected cluster summary: - Largest cluster id 10: size 43,558 (tokens: ‘removed’, ‘im’, ‘ai’, ‘chatgpt’, ‘gpt’, ‘new’, ‘use’, ‘get’) - Cluster 8: size 4,989 (conversational tokens: ‘im’, ‘like’, ‘time’) - Cluster 6: size 511 (technical tokens: ‘ai’, ‘code’, ‘import’, ‘data’)\nInterpretation & current status: - Clustering reveals meaningful groupings that can improve targeted forecasting (modeling per cluster or using cluster as a feature). - No regression model for next-month sentiment forecasting is saved in the repository; implementing this is recommended as the next step.\nNext steps to implement forecasting: 1. Aggregate monthly features per subreddit/cluster: lagged sentiment, topic shares, activity metrics. 2. Train and cross-validate regression models (GBRT, ElasticNet), evaluate with RMSE/MAE/R2. 3. Use interpretability tools (SHAP) to identify key drivers. 4. Deploy forecasting pipeline and produce monthly forecasts with uncertainty bounds."
